# Custom Domains for Canvas Apps

This repository contains the necessary files for implementing custom domains in canvas apps using a static web app. The main file in this repository is the `index.html` file, which serves as the entry point for the custom domain setup.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

Each `index.html` file represents a different canvas app solution. The file located at the root level (`index.html`) is the production version of the main solution. The `billing` folder contains the billing solution, with separate `index.html` files for the production, development (dev), and user acceptance testing (UAT) environments. The `fire` folder also follows the same structure, with separate `index.html` files for the production, dev, and UAT environments.

## Usage

To use this repository, simply copy the desired `index.html` file and modify the iframe link and title according to your specific canvas app solution. The title of each `index.html` file should include the solution name and environment prefix.
